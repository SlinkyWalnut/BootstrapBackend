Speaker 1's emotions during the conversation: {emotions}

Analyze ONLY the new text provided below using these chess move types:
- BRILLIANT: Exceptional, perfect response that the other speaker responds well to. 
    - Example: Date conversation: "You are so beautiful, your smile is so contagious"
- GREAT: Very good response, well-timed and effective
- BEST: Optimal choice in the situation
- EXCELLENT: Strong response, clearly beneficial
- GOOD: Solid choice, generally positive
- BOOK: Standard, extremely predictable expected responses (neutral)
    - Example: "Hey how are you?", "I'm doing well, thanks for asking"
- INACCURACY: Minor mistake, slightly off but not harmful
- MISTAKE: Clear error, poor choice with negative impact
    - Example: Interview conversation: "I didn‚Äôt have time to look at your website."
- BLUNDER: Major error, very damaging to the conversation
    - Example: Date conversation: "You look really different from your pictures."
- MISSED_WIN: Failed to capitalize on a great opportunity
    - Example: Date conversation: "Speaker 1: Do you want to go to the movies?" Speaker 0: "I'm not sure, I have a lot of work to do."

EXAMPLES:

Date

- You look way different from your pictures. (Negative)

- My ex used to love this restaurant. (Negative)

- You have a really genuine laugh. (Positive)

- I really enjoy talking to you. (Positive)

Interview

- I didn‚Äôt have time to look at your website. (Negative)

- I‚Äôm excited about this role ‚Äî it aligns with what I‚Äôve been building toward. (Positive)

Team Meeting

- That idea doesn‚Äôt make sense. (Negative)

- That‚Äôs an interesting approach ‚Äî maybe we can build on that. (Positive)

Friend Chat

- You‚Äôre overreacting. (Negative)

- That sounds really tough ‚Äî want to talk about it? (Positive)



For the new text, return:
1. The exact substring that represents the key part of the move
2. The move type classification
3. Brief reason (1-2 words max)

IMPORTANT: 
- Only analyze the NEW TEXT provided below, not the conversation context
- Return the exact substring that should be highlighted
- You can identify multiple moves within the same text if appropriate
- Provide a score multiplier from 0.5 to 2.0 based on the move quality:
  * 0.5-0.7: Very negative moves (BLUNDER, major MISTAKE)
  * 0.8-0.9: Slightly negative moves (minor MISTAKE, INACCURACY)
  * 1.0: Neutral moves (BOOK, standard responses)
  * 1.1-1.3: Positive moves (GOOD, EXCELLENT)
  * 1.4-2.0: Exceptional moves (GREAT, BEST, BRILLIANT)

Format your response as JSON only, no other text:
{{
    "moves": [
        {{
            "text": "exact substring to highlight",
            "move_type": "MOVE_TYPE",
